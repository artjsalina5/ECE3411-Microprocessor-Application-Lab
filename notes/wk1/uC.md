# Microcontroller Architecture

## uC standard Diagram


## Personal Specification

### Peripherals

- Motor Control (SPI)
- ADC (Analog TOF)
- GPIO Controller (LED)
- Timer
- Debug UART

## Main role of CPU in uC

- Execute program instructions and control operations.

## What type of memory stores the firmware in a microcontroller.

- ROM
- Not the EEPROM

## Why is RAM important in microcontroller

- It temporarily stores the program code during execution

## What is function of I/O interfaces in a mcircontroller?

- To communicate with external devices

## What does the clock signal do in a uC

- Synchronizes internal operations
