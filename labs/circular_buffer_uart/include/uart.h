/**
 * @defgroup uart_api UART Driver API
 * @brief Unified UART driver supporting both interrupt-driven and stdio operations
 * 
 * This driver provides a complete UART solution with two complementary interfaces:
 * 
 * ## Modern Interrupt-Driven API
 * - Non-blocking operations suitable for real-time applications
 * - Automatic buffering via circular buffers
 * - Functions: uart_send_char(), uart_send_string(), uart_receive_char()
 * - Status functions: uart_tx_free_space(), uart_rx_available()
 * 
 * ## Legacy stdio Interface  
 * - Blocking operations compatible with printf(), scanf(), etc.
 * - Line editing capabilities (backspace, ctrl+u, etc.)
 * - Automatic CR+LF conversion for terminal compatibility
 * 
 * ## Usage Example
 * @code
 * #include "uart.h"
 * 
 * int main(void) {
 *     // Initialize UART
 *     uart_init(3, 9600, F_CPU, NULL);
 *     sei(); // Enable global interrupts
 *     
 *     // Use stdio interface
 *     printf("Hello World!\n");
 *     
 *     // Use interrupt-driven interface
 *     uart_send_string("Non-blocking message\n");
 *     
 *     char ch;
 *     if (uart_receive_char(&ch)) {
 *         // Process received character
 *     }
 *     
 *     return 0;
 * }
 * 
 * // Required ISRs (replace USART3 with your USART number)
 * ISR(USART3_RXC_vect) {
 *     uart_rx_isr_handler(USART3.RXDATAL);
 * }
 * 
 * ISR(USART3_DRE_vect) {
 *     char ch;
 *     if (uart_tx_isr_handler(&ch)) {
 *         USART3.TXDATAL = ch;
 *     } else {
 *         USART3.CTRLA &= ~USART_DREIE_bm;
